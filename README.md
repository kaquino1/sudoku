A Sudoku game built in Python with a tkinter GUI. Generates a sudoku puzzle by creating a complete board. A backtracking algorithm randomly removes boxes from the board and backtracks if the puzzle will have more than one solution. The number of filled in boxes in the puzzle depends on the selected difficult. The default is EASY.

### RUN:

```
python3 sudoku.py
```
